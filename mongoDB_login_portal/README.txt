A "login portal" that takes the value from 2 input-boxes(mail and pass), stores them in an object, 
then sends those to my mongoDB-cloud as new entries to the database.

You can then "login", and the program checks mongoDB for the matching email-address and password.

To run it simply run the app.js file in nodejs and start a liveserver with the front-end html-file.
